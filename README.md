From XML to JSON, CSV to Excel, and even Parquet; Data Forge handles a variety of formats, allowing seamless conversions and direct connections to databases for comprehensive data management.

Preview your data, merge files across formats, convert data, compress files, and uncover insights with data summaries that display the row and column dimensions, as well as highlight the missing or null values.

More database connections coming soon! Visualize your findings with simple yet effective bar, scatter, or violin plots. Plus, a built-in bug report form ensures support is always within reach.
